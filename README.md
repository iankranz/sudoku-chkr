# sudoku-chkr

A simple web page for checking the validity sudoku solutions.

Sudoku Chkr uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to allow users to enter sudoku solutions on a grid. At any point, the user can check their solution by clicking a button and the page will notify them if the solution is valid according to standard [sudoku rules](https://sudoku.com/sudoku-rules/). If the solution is not valid, the program will point out one violation of the rules.
